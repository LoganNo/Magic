LOGAN NOZELL, DECK COST FINDER
WIP

'''

'''
Example:
python magic.py
Burn
11 32
	Since these two decks share the same archetype, the second deck should take
	less time to retrieve total cost, as the cost of all previous cards are saved in a dict
	be patient, please
Yes
Graveyard:Phoenix
	Mispelled archetype, oops
Graveyard;Phoenix
5 32
	Deck 5 shouldn't take too long to retrieve the cost
	Deck 32 should be instant
No
	The only time this program *should* fail is if I get a 503 error, in that case I skip finding the cost
	of the deck.

Using the the fact that we know how large each deck and side board is (total_deck_size)
And that the Main_deck_cards or Side_board_cards is just a list of deck waiting to be spliced
And that we know how many of each cards there are in each deck (main_deck/side_board_num_cards)
We can faithfully splice the main_deck_cards list into a list of decks
Each deck will be a list of tuples, the first entry being the name of the card
The second entry being the count of that card in the deck
